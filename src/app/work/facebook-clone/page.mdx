    <li>Feed cards and side panels built with CSS grid and flexbox combos for responsive balance.</li>
    <li>Profile hero modules that adapt to different cover image ratios and copy lengths.</li>
    <li>Full focus-visible treatments and keyboard navigation for posts, actions, and dialogs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Screenshots</h2>

  <h2>Implementation notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>CSS custom properties control spacing and shadows to keep visual rhythm consistent.</li>
    <li>Layered <code>box-shadow</code> recipes emulate Facebook’s depth without heavy assets.</li>
    <li>Semantic HTML ensures sections, asides, and nav elements remain screen-reader friendly.</li>
  </ul>
